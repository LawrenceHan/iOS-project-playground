## Overview

We're moving away from:

* English = India
* Chinese = China

...to supporting multiple languages in the same server, specially:

* English in India
* English in China
* Chinese in China

## Type of issues solved

### localizable string is not localized for desired locale

For iOS, Chinese strings in an English interface is caused by the backend returning Chinese strings embedded into the results.

For example, call to http://api.staging.kangyu.co/v1/account/profiles/989.json

returns:

```
{
  "id": 988,
  "gender": "男",
  "height": null,
  "weight": null,
  "username": "康语0989",
  "thumb_avatar": "http://localhost:3000/assets/thumb_default-df7d019e59aa7451685bb7b8b7aca647.png",
  "age": 34,
  "review_counts": [],
  "medical_experiences_count": 0
}
```

Gender is 男, when it should male in English.

### Large number of strings

This requires a bit more work.

## Root causes

### not using i18n.t

After some investigation, there seems to be at least one case where the problem is caused by:

* not using i18n.t for a returned string (using static arrays of values instead...)
* not having the lookup string in config/locales/default.LANG-REGION.yml (zh-CN, en)

The API supports ?locale= out of the box without any additional change, so display strings should be returned in the desired locale (while changing a value is done with the internal key to the database).

### inserting string in Chinese

For review questions, the strings loaded in the initial DB is directly in a single language instead of following the convention to store in English and localize.


### editing and importing strings override

For now, we use Google Sheets to manage our translations with one-shot imports into a translations table using the following query:

```
=arrayformula({
query(departments!A2:C, "SELECT A, TRIM(C), 'departments', 'name', 'en' WHERE C <> '' LABEL A '', C '', 'departments' '', 'name' '', 'en' ''")
;
query(physicians!A2:D, "SELECT A, D,'physicians', 'name', 'en'  WHERE D <> '' LABEL A '', D '', 'physicians' '', 'name' '', 'en' ''")
;
query(specialities!A2:D, "SELECT A, C,'specialities', 'name', 'en'  WHERE C <> '' LABEL A '', C '', 'specialities' '', 'name' '', 'en' ''")
;
query(conditions!A2:D, "SELECT A, C,'conditions', 'name', 'en'  WHERE C <> '' LABEL A '', C '', 'conditions' '', 'name' '', 'en' ''")
;
query(symptoms!A2:D, "SELECT A, C,'symptoms', 'name', 'en'  WHERE C <> '' LABEL A '', C '', 'symptoms' '', 'name' '', 'en' ''")
})
```

## Additional work

### yml -> redis

research:

* find specific example and make sure the t() is called on it

prototype:

* run application locally and find specific string to be translated
* add Redis as a first Key value store in a chain
* insert new translation manually
* see result
* pull request and push

next:

* override locale
* change code to select language based on locale
* write translation lookup test
* create translations loader for Redis

later:

* add internal interface to manage translations
* integrate to weblate
