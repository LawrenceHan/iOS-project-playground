\
A summa cum laude graduate of the University of Alabama, Dr. Emblom earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry and mathematics. He received his medical degree from the University of Alabama School of Medicine and completed a residency in orthopaedic surgery at UAB Hospital. He then completed a one-year orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship with Dr. James Andrews at the American Sports Medicine Institute. Following that, he completed additional training in hip arthroscopy with Dr. Thomas Byrd in Nashville, which provided focused training in arthroscopic and mini-open surgery for non-arthritic hip disorders.
\

\
Dr. Emblom presents research and delivers instructional lectures at numerous orthopaedic and specialty related conferences. He has also authored research and book chapters on topics related to orthopaedics and sports medicine. Dr. Emblom currently performs clinical and biomechanical research at the American Sports Medicine Institute (ASMI).
\

\
Dr. Emblom holds a special passion for the field of sports medicine because he participated in sports throughout his childhood. Pediatric sports injuries are of particular interest, including ACL injuries of the knee and throwing injuries to the elbow. One aspect of sports he admired was the goals that a team could accomplish together. Now, as a team physician for Samford University, the University of Alabama and Hoover High School, Dr. Emblom is again working on a team to accomplish a shared goal: to keep players safe and to return them to the field after an injury.
\

\
Dr. Emblom's commonly performed arthroscopic and reconstructive procedures include: shoulder surgeries such as rotator cuff repair, instability and labral repair and AC joint reconstruction; elbow surgeries such as ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (Tommy John), distal biceps tendon repair and arthroscopic loose body removal and tennis elbow release; knee surgeries such as ligament reconstruction (ACL, PCL, MCL, posterolateral corner), arthroscopic meniscus repair and patella instability (MPFL reconstruction); and hip surgeries such as non-arthritic hip preservation with labral repair and femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) correction, snapping hip release and athletic pubalgia, or sports hernia, repair. Mesenchymal stem cell augmentation has been a more recent addition to his surgical armamentarium. 
\

\
Dr. Emblom has received many awards and honors, including the Kurt Niemann, M.D. Outstanding Orthopaedic Chief Resident Award (2008), UASOM Dean's Achievement Award (2002), Alpha Omega Alpha (2001), APC Pathology Honor Society (2001), Russell-Roberts Medical Scholarship (2001), Newsome-Osment Medical Scholarship (2000), Long Medical Scholarship (1999), Peacock Teaching Fellowship (1999), J.

433,JøRN S. JøRGENSEN,,Med,,da,M,,"Founder and CEO of EuroEyes Clinical Group
\

\
Eye surgeon and specialist in ophthalmology
\

\
Medical Director of the EuroEyes Clinical Group
\

\
Dr. Jørn S. Jørgensen is a specialist in ophthalmology, has 25 years of experience as an eye surgeon, and is a trailblazer in Denmark and Germany in the field of refractive and cataract surgery. He is among the pioneers of a new generation who have established a new paradigm in the field of ophthalmology. 
\

\
The Danish born Dr. Jørgensen completed his studies in medicine at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. Later he moved to Hamburg, where he completed his medical training in 1986 at the University Eye Clinic Eppendorf. 
\

\
Dr. Jørgensen, who has always been considered a cosmopolitan with great interest in innovations, has gained his experience in several countries, including Norway, St. Gallen in Switzerland, as chief and head physician in Bremen, Germany, and in Spain, where he worked in the private clinic Navarro in Gijon and Oviedo. 
\

\
Throughout his work, he was always increasingly interested in the field of refractive surgery. He wanted to know how to correct vision disorders and how to succeed in achieving change for the better – how to offer patients a sustainable alternative to their conventional vision aids. To find answers to these questions, he went to Florida, where he completed extensive training in refractive surgery at Newman Eye Institute, which at the time was considered one of the leading institutions in this field.
\

\
Dr. Jørgensen wanted to bring his acquired expertise to his chosen hometown, Hamburg. Parallel to his new-found passion for refractive surgery he succeeded in 1990 as the first eye surgeon to perform outpatient cataract surgery – using a new micro-incision technique (phacoemulsification). Less than a year later, he introduces the &quot;no-stitch cataract surgery&quot;. He always pursues the objective of making the treatments to patients as gentle and nice as possible. With a view to maintaining the patients’ health and quality of life it is even possible altogether to waive the usual hospital stay of 5 days.
\

\
In 1993 EuroEyes Hamburg was founded by Dr. Jørgensen – the flagship of the current company - after he, a year prior to this, succeeds in introducing LASIK for the correction of vision disorders in the Hanseatic city.
\

\
The innovative mind of its founder, helps the company to rapid growth and allows within a few years EuroEyes to successfully establish itself as Germany’s largest independent clinical group for refractive surgery.
\

\
Always one step ahead, Dr. Jørgensen is in 2006 one of the founders of the LASIK TÜV in Germany. The seal of approval is for patients as a guide when selecting a professional LASIK clinic. It certifies the highest possible quality standards according to the strictest criteria.
\

\
Today, EuroEyes is considered the leading address in Germany and Denmark for the treatment of refractive disorders, and applies a major pioneering role in the treatment of presbyopia, ICL implantation, Femto-LASIK, and much more.
\

\
With his absolute commitment and surgical experience, Dr. Jørgensen is considered the top expert in the overall spectrum of surgical vision correction.
\

\
His success has already reached the magic number of 100,000 eye surgeries carried out by hand (50,000 lens implantations and more than 50,000 LASIK treatments).
\

\
He is in first-class television, radio and print media such as Stern, Schümanns Hamburger, Focus, Der Welt, Hamburger Abendblatt, the TV channel Hamburg 1 and the NDR broadcast &quot;Visits&quot;, and is present as a speaker in numerous national and international conferences.
\

\
In 2011 Dr. Jørgensen was, as the only surgeon for cataract and refractive surgery in Hamburg, recommended from Focus – Focus-Ärzteliste.
\

\
Following his vision completely, Dr. Jørgensen sets in November 2011 with EuroEyes - the first German hospital group ever - the foundation for a location in China. The official clinic opening in east China's financial capital Shanghai takes place in April 2013.
