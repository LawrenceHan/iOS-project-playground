  - Updated native mediation framework to support Facebook Audience Network SDK 3.18.2

### IMPORTANT UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS

As of version 3.0.0, the MoPub SDK uses Automatic Reference Counting. If you're upgrading from an earlier version (2.4.0 or earlier) that uses Manual Reference Counting, in order to minimize integration errors with the manual removal of the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag, our recommendation is to completely remove the existing MoPub SDK from your project and then integrate the latest version. Alternatively, you can manually remove the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag from all MoPub SDK files. If your project uses Manual Reference Counting, you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to all MoPub SDK files.

## Version 2.4 (August 28th, 2014)

  - **Simplified native ads integration**: integration instructions and documentation are available on the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/wiki/Native-Ads-Integration)

## Version 2.2 (June 19th, 2014)

  - **Native ads content filtering**: Added the ability to specify which native ad elements you want to receive from the MoPub Marketplace to optimize bandwidth use and download only required assets, via `MPNativeAdRequestTargeting.desiredAssets`. This feature only works for the six standard Marketplace assets, found in `MPNativeAdConstants.h`. Any additional elements added in direct sold ads will always be sent down in the extras.
  - Added star rating information to the `MPNativeAd` object, via `MPNativeAd.starRating`. This method returns an `NSNumber` (double value) corresponding to an app's rating on a 5-star scale.
